<h3>
Linear and Quadratic
</h3>
<p>	
    Functions can take many forms with the first one displayed here being linear.
    Linear functions can be identified by their constant rate of change making them a straight line.
    The most common way to write a linear function is with slope intercept form (y = mx + b) where m is 
    your slope and b is your y intercept.
    Next are quadratic functions which can be identified by their reversing curve known as a parabola.
    The most common form for quadratic equations is the general form (ax^2 + bx + c) where a, b, and c are real numbers.
</p>
<h3>
Exponential and Logarithmic
</h3>
<p>	
    Exponentials are third and they are identified in how they flatten out on one end known as a horizontal asymptote 
    and rapidly increase at another.
    Their formula is (a*b^x) where a the y intercept and b is a value greater than 0.
    Lastly, logarithmic functions can be identified by an infinite increase on one end known as a vertical asymptote
    and level off on the other. 
    The formula for logarithms is (log_b(a) = c) there b is the base that is raised by c to get a.
    Logarithms and exponentials act as inverses to one another meaning they are reflections of each other across the line (x = y).
