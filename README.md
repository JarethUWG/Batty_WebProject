A site for Adapting an online math resource for students to empower students learn at their own pace.

The site should have no installation process for users only requiring a link to the site.

To use the site click the navigation options aT the top depending on what you need.
The site currently lacks most of its content pages so the high school math link is currently non-functional.
The pages which are currently implemented have segments of text which hold their main topic and additional graphics or features the user can interact with.
All return navigation options currently return the user to index.html.
