<h3>
Limits
</h3>
<p>	
In math not all concepts can be explained by functions alone in some cases modifiers need to be imposed onto values to 
fully convey the concept.
This is what limits attempt to achieve as they specifiy a point a value is going to whether that is a particular number or an
enless series like infinity. 
For example if f(x) = x^2 then f(x+h) = (x+h)^2 or simplified f(x+h) = x^2+2xh+h^2 but if we impose the limit lim h->0 
then we are refering to the behavior as h approches 0 which would lead to x^2+2xh+h^2 = x^2 as 2*x*0 = 0 and 0^2 = 0.
</p>
<h3>
Derivatives
</h3>
<p>	
An example of a limit being deployed can be found in derivatives which are utilized to find the instantaneous rate of change.
The definition of a derivative is lim h->0 (f(x+h)-f(x))/h with f(x) serving as your given function.
This can be used to find the tangent line for a given point which has the same rate of change as the curve for that given point 
which is referred to as the instantaneous rate of change.
