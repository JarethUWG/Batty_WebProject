<h3>
Sine, Consine, Tangent
</h3>
<p>	
Sine, cosine, and tangent are useful ratios which can be derived from measuring the various sides of a right triangle.
From one of the non-right angles of a right trangle you have 3 sides an adjacent which is touching the angle, 
the opposite which is the side directly across from the angle, and the hypotenuse which is the angle across from the right angle.
To get the values of the adjacent, opposite, and hypotenuse you can measure their lengths.
Once you have their lengths you can get sine by dividing the opposite by the hypotenuse, 
the cosine by dividing the adjacent by the hypotenuse, and the tangent by dividing the opposite by the adjacent.
</p>
<h3>
Cosecant, Secant, Cotangent
</h3>
<p>	
Cosecant, secant, cotangent are the reciprocal functions of sine, cosine, and tangent respectively.
You could get each of them by putting them into a fraction with one as the numerator and the base function as the divisor.
For example cosecant would be 1/sin and sin is opposite/hypotenuse so ultimatly cosecant would be hypotenuse/oppsite.
Similar applies to the other two reciprocal functions with secant being 1/cos resolving to hypotenuse/adjacent, and
cotangent being 1/tan resolving to adjacent/hypotenuse.
