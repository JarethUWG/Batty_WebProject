<h3>
Perpendicular And Parallel Lines
</h3>
<p>	
    There are various states lines can take on a flat plane with a few unique cases being perpendicular and parallel lines.
    When lines are perpendicular they meet perfectly straight with each other creating 4 different 90 degree angles.
    Perpendicular lines can also be confirmed by checking the slopes of the lines. 
    If multiplying the slopes of two linear lines together results in -1 they are perpendicular.
    Parallel lines are directly opposite to perpendicular ones as they are two lines which never meet each other.
    If two linear lines have the same slope but not the same intercepts then they are parallel. 
</p>
<h3>
Similarity And Congruence
</h3>
<p>	
    While similarity and congruence may appear to be the same at first there are a few differences between them.
    Two shapes are similar if they are the same core shape but with sizes that may be different.
    This means if you expanded or contracted all the sides by the same amount the new shape would be similar to the original shape.
    Congruence goes a bit further with not only the same core shape but size as well.
    This means that if two shapes are congruent they are also similar.
