Median and mode.
</h3>
<p>	
Two measures of center for a data set are median and mode. 
To find the median find the middle value, for an odd set this would be the number in the position of the number of elements divided by 2 rounded up and 
for even sets the middle value would be the sum of the numbers in the position of the number of elements divided by 2 and the one above it all divided by 2.
Mode can be found by finding the value which occurs the most.
If no values repeat there is no modes and if mutiple numbers tie for the most occurances those values are all modes.

<h3>
Mean and weighted mean.
</h3>
<p>	
To find the mean of a set add all the values of a set together and divide the total by the number of items in the set.
To get a weighted mean you must take all values in a set and multiply them by each of their weighted values.
Then when you have your weighted values add them together to get your weighted mean.
For the table presented here the weighted mean representing the final grade would be 84.2.
